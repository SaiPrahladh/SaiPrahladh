### Hi there 👋
## Haaave you met Sai?
👋 # Hello there

🧑‍🎓 I am a final year ECE Master's student at CMU with my interests in AI, ML, DL and CV!!

💬 Always up for a conversation on deep learning and discuss 🌝 moonshot projects, 'cos why not?

📘 Currently I am working on topics related to Computer Vision and Machine Vision and have also dabbled
   a bit in the NLP domain. I also enjoy the process of Rapid Prototyping!

🎸🎵 I am always down for a jam session as I absolutely love to sing. Also, if you are a foodie, we will
   get along really well.
   
⚽ Apart from this, I love watching and playing football.

Explore my work through my repositories. Also shoot me an email if you think we can engage in a productive discussion
over an idea. @ ✉️ saiprahalad08@gmail.com
